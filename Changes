Revision history and release notes for Event::RPC:

0.84 Mon Jul 25, 2005, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Buffering for big incoming RPC requests (> 64KB) didn't
	  work properly

0.83 Fri Apr 15, 2005, joern
	Features:
	- Made more parts of the API public by documenting them.
	- New server option "connection_hook" for accessing
	  Event::RPC::Connection objects during connecting and
	  disconnecting.
	- New server option "auto_reload_modules" to control the
	  server's auto reloading facility, which was activated
	  by default up to now.
	- New server option "host" to bind the listener to a
	  specific address. Default is to bind to all addresses.
	- Increased connect performance by reducing the number
	  of messages exchanged between client and server.
	- Client may request a subset of exported server classes.
	  Default is still to import all classes exported by the
	  server.
	- Client checks Event::RPC version and used protocol version
	  on connect and warns different software versions but dies
	  on incompatible protocol versions. Naturally it's
	  recommended to use the same Event::RPC version on server
	  and client.
	- Methods for getting client and server (after connecting)
	  software and protocol version numbers.
	
	Bugfixes:
	- Missed ReuseAddr on listener sockets.
	- Made testsuite more robust
	- Network logging clients could block the server by
	  sending data to it.
	- Renamed client option 'server' to 'host', which is more
	  adequate. 'server' is still allowed but deprecated and
	  using it triggers a warning.

0.82 Sun Apr 10, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- First public release. API is fairly stable.
	
	Features:
	- User/password based authentication added.
	- Full documentation added.
	- Test suite added which covers all connection
	  types and the most important features.

0.81 Sun Mar 13, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- Still an internal release, incomplete documentation, no
	  test suite.
	
	Features:
	- Support for SSL encryption added using IO::Socket::SSL.
	- Event loop abstraction. Event::RPC now works with Event
	  and Glib and can be easily extended for other event loop
	  frameworks. Thanks to Rocco Caputo for the suggestion.

0.80 Sun Mar 13, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- A non public release. Only announced on the perl-loop mailing
	  list for the namespace request and to get comments. Module
	  is fully working but API isn't documented yet very well.
	  Security stuff (SSL encryption, some password authentication)
	  is missing also a complete test suite.

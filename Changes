Revision history and release notes for Event::RPC:

0.82 Sun Apr 10, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- First public release. API is fairly stable.
	
	Features:
	- User/password based authentication added.
	- Full documentation added.
	- Test suite added which covers all connection
	  types and the most important features.

0.81 Sun Mar 13, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- Still an internal release, incomplete documentation, no
	  test suite.
	
	Features:
	- Support for SSL encryption added using IO::Socket::SSL.
	- Event loop abstraction. Event::RPC now works with Event
	  and Glib and can be easily extended for other event loop
	  frameworks. Thanks to Rocco Caputo for the suggestion.

0.80 Sun Mar 13, 2005, joern
	Notes:
	- A non public release. Only announced on the perl-loop mailing
	  list for the namespace request and to get comments. Module
	  is fully working but API isn't documented yet very well.
	  Security stuff (SSL encryption, some password authentication)
	  is missing also a complete test suite.
